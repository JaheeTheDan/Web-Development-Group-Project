The Programme explained:

In the case that the admin would like to access the Dashboard, they would use the following credentials - 

Admin username = "admin"
Admin Password = "admin_123"

Once on the dashboard, they would be able to view the user frequency which includes:
- How many registered users fall under specific gender categories (e.g. Male, Female, Other)
- Registered users under different age groups (18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 50+)
This is displayed in the format of bargraphs.
Tool Used: Chart API

Regular User Experience explained:

Registering :
User creates an account using Name, username, password, trn, gender and date of birth (which is used to calculate the age of user so their age is added to the stats on the dashboard)

login:
User enters Trn and password to access account.
In the case that the credential dont match the ones inputed on registering, an error message will be displayed and after 3 attempts the user is sent to Error page where a link back to the home page is displayed.

Once user is logged in successfully, they are able to navigate the through the About Us Page, Home Page, Service Page and Cart.
